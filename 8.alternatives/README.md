## Alternative methods that we followed:

- **I3D:** We tried I3D model on our features but we didin't manage to get propoer results.

- **blink detection:** We performed 3 different blink detection metodhs: i) simple thresholding ii) adaptive model ii) machine learning model. We were planning to uses these methods to extract blink-based features, but we gave up on these later.

- **face crop:** We planned to use raw frames to train CNN models by cropping faces alternatively. It will be implemented as future work.

- **gabor filterbank:** Gabor features were also considered in the first stages but they were not suitable for our case.
